# SQL-Sales-Data-Analytics

A comprehensive collection of SQL scripts for data exploration, analytics, and reporting. This repository demonstrates how to query and analyze sales data in a relational database using best practices in SQL.


The queries in this project showcase practical applications such as:

  - Exploring database schema and metadata

  - Generating key business metrics (sales, revenue, customer counts)

  - Analyzing time-based trends and seasonality

  - Building cumulative and running totals

  - Customer/product segmentation and performance analysis

  - Preparing data for reporting and dashboards
    

This repository is designed as a portfolio project to demonstrate SQL proficiency, problem-solving ability, and a clear workflow for real-world analytics.
